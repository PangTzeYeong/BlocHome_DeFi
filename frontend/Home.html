		- A smart contract is an agreement that needs no external action to execute the terms of the contract. Once the conditions for its execution have been met, the smart contract completes the agreed actions automatically.

        <br>
        <br>
		- Blockchain technology maintains a record of transactions is maintained across several computers linked in a peer-to-peer network. This allows smart contracts to be self-executing, with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into lines of code existing on a decentralized network
		
        <br>
		<br>
		
		- Smart contracts render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.
		<br>
		<br>
		- Ethereum Real Estate Contracts are Flexible as contracts may be written so that any number of final sales prices, reductions in price, or increases, can be triggered based on specific events agreed to by the parties.

    <p class="textPara">
	
	- Blockchain technology has recently been adopted and adapted for use by the commercial real estate (CRE) industry. CRE executives are finding that blockchain-based smart contracts can play a much larger role in their industry. Blockchain technology can potentially transform core CRE operations such as property transactions like purchase, sale, financing, leasing, and management transactions.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	- Blockchain technology has impacted the real estate industry in a variety of ways, including offering a new means for buyers and sellers to connect with one another.
	<br>
	<br>
	- Blockchain could be used to cut intermediaries out of the real estate transaction process, thereby reducing costs.
	<br>
	<br>
		
	- This technology could also help to codify the practice of fractional ownership of real estate.

		<b><a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/"><u>Solidity</u></a></b> - is an object-oriented, high-level programming language for implementing smart contracts. With Solidity, one can set up conditions, different stakeholders, amounts, and other rules governing the agreement. All these rules are coded into the program. Once compiled, the executable can run the on the Ethereum network. That could be either a test network or the real actual Ethereum platform.
